Collection of codes in Matlab(R) for solving basic problems presented and discussed in the "Computational Fluid Dynamics of Reactive Flows" course (Politecnico di Milano)

## 1. Advection-diffusion equation in 1D
The advection-diffusion equation is solved on a 1D domain using the finite-difference method. Constant, uniform velocity and diffusion coefficients are assumed. The forward (or explicit) Euler method is adopted for the time discretization, while spatial derivatives are discretized using 2nd-order, centered schemes.

* Matlab live script: [advection_diffusion_1d_live.mlx](codes/advection_diffusion_1d_live.mlx)

## 2. Advection-diffusion equation in 2D
The advection-diffusion equation is solved on a 2D rectangular domain using the finite-difference method. Constant, uniform velocity components and diffusion coefficients are assumed. The forward (or explicit) Euler method is adopted for the time discretization, while spatial derivatives are discretized using 2nd-order, centered schemes.

## 3. Poisson equation in 2D
The Poisson equation is solved on a 2D rectangular domain using the finite-difference method. A constant source term is initially adopted. Spatial derivatives are discretized using 2nd-order, centered schemes. Different methods are adopted for solving the equation: the Jacobi method, the Gauss-Siedler method, and the Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) method

* Matlab live script: [poisson_2d_live.mlx](codes/poisson_2d_live.mlx)

## 4. Navier-Stokes equations in 2D: vorticity-streamline formulation
The Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid are solved on a 2D rectangular domain according to the vorticity-streamline formulation. The vorticity advection-diffusion equation is dolved using the forward Euler method and 2nd order, centered spatial discretizations. The streamline function Poisson equation is solved using the Successive Over-Relaxation method and 2nd order, centered discretization for the spatial derivatives.
